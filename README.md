GENERATIVE-METHODS-IN-GENOMICS

Data Miner: The Data Miner component is responsible for collecting Fastq files from various sources, such as online databases or local storage repositories. It employs web scraping techniques or interacts with APIs to retrieve Fastq files relevant to the user's research interests.

Organizer: Once the Fastq files are collected, the Organizer component categorizes and organizes them based on metadata information such as sample identifiers, experimental conditions, or sequence characteristics. This ensures efficient management and retrieval of data during subsequent analysis steps.

Data Loader: The Data Loader component reads and preprocesses the Fastq files, extracting important sequence information such as read length, quality scores, and nucleotide composition. It prepares the data for downstream analysis tasks, including machine learning and variant calling.

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): The GAN component employs deep learning techniques to generate synthetic DNA sequences that mimic the characteristics of real Fastq files. By learning from the patterns and distributions present in the training data, the GAN can produce realistic synthetic sequences for augmenting datasets or testing algorithms.

Variant Generator: The Variant Generator component introduces genetic variations into existing DNA sequences to simulate mutagenesis or evolutionary processes. It can generate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, or other types of mutations based on user-defined parameters.
